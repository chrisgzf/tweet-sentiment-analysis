670,depressed,@Rockstar66_6 There are say many people Chester Bennington Robin Williams and Gary Speed(soccer coach) all had families and were married. But once that depressed takes hold of you it's very difficult to see a way out! Thankfully alot of people do imagine constantly being in the public eye!💜

696,cheerful,Guys. I am highly aware of the rampant cultural appropriation in K-pop styling. Never stood for it never will. Lisa's pony-braids were a flagrant example of stylists and execs staying willfully ignorant. Girls = great. Song = a bop. Visuals = awesome. The braids = shit choice.

778,depressed,"@Camellia_Alexan This kind of talk while well meaning is dangerous. Someone who has a chemical imbalance may not be able to ""cure"" depression this way and telling them that they should be able to do it when they can't only makes it worse for them. Be cautious with this type of ""help""."

812,depressed,@louisclem7 @DomTheBombYT @BreannaSoftbal1 He has nobody he can talk to (determinately clementine) because he won’t be taken seriously and he wants to hold up his happy act. It’s dangerous to keep all that in and that can lead to very serious mental health issues like depression.
813,depressed,I had no idea theres such thing as a #ativan hangover the next day..  all the non stop anxiety panic attacks I needed my anti medication because I thought was doing so well. Time to recuperate and love myself again. Depression comes in waves. I'll take the wave. I got dis.
814,depressed,They say there is five stages of grief:1- Denial2- Anger3- Bargaining4- Depression 5- AcceptanceI guess some people never make it to the acceptance phase. They just keep swinging between the anger and depression phases which is really sad.
815,depressed,do you know what depression feels like? it feels like a thousand pound weight holding your body down in a pool of water barely reaching your chin. so no matter how bad your neck hurts you gotta keep your head up to survive.
816,depressed,Depression u can’t have me

1200,suicidal,Just read this. I am completely appalled. #TransHealth #TransKidsImagine youre a child w dysphoria & instead of trying to find the roots to help you cope help you live a better life your therapist tells you an unstable child to threaten suicide?  
1201,suicidal,This is not okay. This is what drove @Avicii and many others to suicide. It’s not okay. People need to understand EVERYONE has feelings. Being a total dick and hating someone’s work doesn’t make you a fan it makes you a FAKE. Shame on all you people that did this!

1205,suicidal,@CentralMorgan @essayareayaitch My bad. Thank you for correcting me. I'm not surprised re sharper increase for girls. There's rampant anti-female BS going on all over the national stage right now (the Jones Day lawsuit for example). You are 100% right that teen suicide doesn't need to be a gendered issue.
1206,suicidal,Non-violence is very contextual in the context of yoga. To make it a normative principle as Gandhi did is suicidal and adharmic.

1357,depressed,I remember when I was about 15? 16? being so depressed that I couldn't even leave my bed & my room just being so messy.. and telling my mom I was too depressed to clean my room & she would literally clean my room for me .. nothing compares to cancer love honestly.
1358,depressed,Updated: my legs are shaking skin glowing and emotions are at all time positive high HA take that depression
1359,depressed,some girl in my class asked me why i always look so sad and i’m like it’s the depression thanks
1360,depressed,@DirtKobain98 Bruh. After 3 days of strait depressed suicidal thoughts when I finally found myself excited and happy my first thought was “hopefully I die today while I’m not depressed” followed by “wtf is wrong with me i still have so many goals and dreams.” It’s a struggle ur not alone.
1361,depressed,I could really take a 14 hour depressed nap. That’s all bad

1371,depressed,People with a mental illness aren’t crazy.People with anxiety aren’t rude.People with depression aren’t lazy. People with suicidal aren’t attention  seekers. It’s so important to raise awareness and that mental illnesses are real.
1372,depressed,@nicknemeroff @SpencerAdamus Robin Williams was the one of the greatest jokers of all time. He was depressed.

1374,depressed,2. make the decision to live intentionally to the best of your ability. this can be so hard when you are depressed. but even baby steps are helpful. take care of yourself even when you dont feel like it. eat lots of plants. go about your day with a purpose whatever it is.
1375,depressed,@Ammar_says_ R u depressed:-(
1376,depressed,@_itsbrenduchis Depression plus you weren’t being my friend at the time so there’s that. 😂
1377,depressed,you may show signs that are out of the norm. some people are high functioning while having depression it’s not always disguised as crying all the time or wanting to be alone
1378,depressed,it is very possible to have depression and not know it and that’s something no one ever talks about

1469,sad,@sammy_scroggss I can not for the life of me fathom how a man can mentally and physically abuse women. Especially women that love them. This is sad. She hid the abuse for 3 years which proves you never truly know what goes on behind closed doors. 😕

1480,sad,@frantasy72 @realDonaldTrump That's actually an insult to teenage girls.  I think even they would have more sense.  Too bad the so called president does not.  It's just sad.
1481,sad,@lou40643222 I am too! I’ve known of one incident where a man was in a nearby supermarket with a knife and that’s it. There was a bomb scare at a high school in Newcastle last year but nothing other than that. It just makes me sad. I’m sorry that happened at your daughters school x
1482,sad,*spoiler alert*Whatever is making you feel anxious upset or sad right now won’t matter in a few days weeks or years. Everything will be okay just take things as they come. Don’t overthink things you’re way much more powerful than you think you are.
1483,sad,This is a sad day for democracy. Leader McConnell and @SenateGOP just shortened debate time for executive nominees from 30 hours to 2 hours. 2 hours is not nearly enough time to properly vet nominees to these important posts.

3274,depressed,Depression :/
3275,depressed,@Poltergeyst_ Depression wouldn't be depression if it was so easy to make the decision to do something about it. Depression takes away d will to live and that's why it is important to check on our loved ones remind them that we need them so that they can fight for life. They can't do it alone
3276,depressed,Mad to think that people actually beat anxiety and depression. Like people actually flip things and feel like a normal human being after feeling like they could never feel okay again.

3283,depressed,@BillKristol Bill Mussolini made the trains run on time. Street crime was down on Hitler's watch. Japanese GDP rose under Hirohito (Great Depression everywhere else). Are you thinking low unemployment balances out Trump Administration crimes against humanity and treason?
3284,depressed,Just because I do not agree with democrats narrative on climate change does not mean I disagree with being good to the environment. I also save money through reusing and recycling stuff habits from my boomer parents and depression era grandparents.
3285,depressed,@engarb6 @Morninglife9 @Fashionluks #ShareTheLove Thanks Twitter tells me my activity is questionable. I guess someone has reported something I shared? I am trying to motivate the unloved depressed & unmotivated living day to day for health or financial reasons.

3692,sad,@LgTeknii @PaperPlate_Mask @AngryJoeShow Which makes me sad because I think the idea of politcs is ingenius and leads to interesting topics and conversations and I am 100% for free speech but right now its just too toxic too black or white and that leads to ecochambers destroying the purpose of politics
3693,sad,that feeling when you're not necessarily sad but you just feel really empty

3702,sad,@SamSicilia Very sad. I was on a call with Airbus this week who commented that they're excited by Australia's transformation from digging things out of the ground to leveraging our intelligent workforce to drive an innovation economy. Unfortunately support here isn't coming from politicians.
3703,sad,Very proud that my very politically-minded 11 yr old took time to protest today. To those who keep saying that kids are being told to do this - she had to ask many adults to find out if she and others could participate - so sad that many don't accept kids have their own opinions

3706,sad,@BurialOfTheDead @byronaaugust @Sean_G_S @ConceptualJames @glukianoff It's beyond sad the trash that counts for a rebuttal against established gender theory and what irritates me more than anything else is the absolute stupidity that people express when they buy into the shit that cranks like James are selling.

3716,sad,"That ""how Anthem went wrong"" article makes me sad. Not so much because of all of the unfortunate things that happened on that project but because non-game devs don't realize these things happen on _every_ big project. I'm sad because those problems aren't at all remarkable."

3725,sad,@toadmeister @DiB1017 It would certainly be difficult to 'ham up' a pantomime villain. The sad thing these days is the sexualisation of pantomime dames.

3742,sad,@LindseySharratt I agree with less emphasis of non-acamedic but  sad to think that there may be some fantastic new coder or economist out there yet their or their parents position in soceity means they will never fly high.Sorry but your party are the Clippers of these wings.

3750,sad,@DefendDemocracy @MoveOn @Public_Citizen @MarchForTruth17 @IndivisibleTeam @StandUpAmerica @peoplefor @NoOneIsAboveLaw @TheLoyalO @FredWertheimer Sad but highly objectionable for the White House occupier to - by inaction and kompromat allows adversary nation states to weaken or democracy. If we love our country we must  Defend it.  GOP why are U turning a blind eye?
3751,depressed,I have no excitement in my life and it’s making me depressed. 🥺
3752,depressed,@PsychScientists @_kevinhector_ Yes just so. Depression is an illness & when we're unwell we need to be extra kind and gentle with ourselves. And all those cyclical negative thoughts we can't escape are just a part of that illness. We're not weak or broken we're champions for enduring such bleak misery.
3753,depressed,I failed my parents because they thought I was going to graduate college I failed myself because I keep letting my depression get the best of me and I ruin everything that's good for me I'm so behind on everything and I feel like it's not worth it anymore I just wanna give up

3772,depressed,@rome_viharo @jbillinson Depression and anxiety is a bit over the top... no one I’ve heard of has become depressed or anxious over the game but i agree it is very addicting and it really gets on my nerves when my brother rages and argues with people on game chat over it...
3773,depressed,Made myself eat despite depression peddling the lie that starving myself is okay.
3774,depressed,@Serious_Sellout Thanks for the advice and I do.  As a result I find this depection of the progressive socialist liberal democrats very revealing of their nature where they are  unable to find a better way to express their depressed state when out in civil society.
3775,depressed,Me: having a great day Something shitty: hiMe: oh no :(My depression: let’s think about nothing else for a week
3776,depressed,wow my anxiety and depression is really fucking my day up love that
3777,depressed,“There is no cure for diabetes depression inflammatory bowel disease......”That self defeatist bullshit argument leads to drug dependency and chronic “disease management” which btw is a crappy concept developed by the pharmaceutical industry!We can damn sure do better
3778,depressed,Im depressed as fuck
3779,depressed,@lacie_dean And if you get this report when apple gives you your screen time report I go into full out depression

3784,depressed,Hormone replacement therapy is not like halloween candy that should be handed out to anyone who wants it it's in the name its therapy therapy for what? Therapy for gender dysphoria. it's not a cosmetic injection you wouldn't take anti depressants if you werent depressed.

3788,depressed,@Anxt13 @Shadow_duck76 I was diagnosed with panic and anxiety disorder that leads to depression back when I was 12. Most day's I am fine and just my old self. However on some days I just feel that shadowy monster slowly creep up on my back and weight me down.
3789,depressed,@jackiepatie Is this the “depression is a choice” cunt?
3790,depressed,i’ve had the shittiest day lmfao i &lt;3 anxiety n depression
3791,depressed,@kidwithdrugs @zxxnat_2 Nah depression isn't a chemical imbalance. There's legit no way to actually prove that and it's merely a theory. Antidepressants aren't solutions they merely mask symptoms and are highly addictive- a ploy developed by pharmaceutical companies
3792,depressed,I love that mental health is becoming a destigmatised topic but I also hate it because now it's apparently cool to be depressed and it's so fucking annoying for people who actually deal with the shit for years on end that it becomes a joke
3793,depressed,So I just got off of work so I figured I pick up some I'm low key depressed but imma eat it away food. So I went to taco bell across the street. Mind you there was a black couple around my age a white dude and an all black staff there. 
3794,depressed,@LeeSwaneyBeReal Thanks for being so transparent @LeeSwaneyBeReal ! I truly believe that transparency helps others to feel less alone. I personally struggle with PTSD clinical depression and anxiety.
3795,depressed,@AndrewYang Years ago I began reading The End of Work by Jeremy Rifkin. Please let me know if you've read his book. He published it in 1995 & he warned technology was going to be the end to work & that we had better start preparing or we're in for another depression.
3796,depressed,Does anyone else make a depression tea? You don't really feel like eating anything but know you should? What's the first thing you reach for? Tonight it was smoked cheese and malteasers i'll probably have nightmares.
3797,depressed,When you're alone you reflect. You reflect then over think. You over think then regret. You regret and become depressed!
3798,depressed,happy birthday kurapika !! thinking about you makes me clinically depressed 
3799,depressed,Ripped my pants dropped my phone and also depressed what a great day
3800,depressed,@OtogeNoRuari That's how it was for me! And then I slowly realized more and oh suddenly I was severly depressed got to a psychologist and BOOM. But it can be anything and nothing you have to feel how you really are if you're already depressed and anxious. 1/2

3815,depressed,@paulkrugman No economist here.  But why is the US GDP not +4% ?  Obama prevented the Second Great Depression and delivered a healthy thriving stable economy to this guy.  It's been +2 years and he's Golfing away the Oval time.
3816,depressed,@GuanyiYang @simardcasanova @causalinf I suffer from depression myself so I would never do that. But I do think it’s a question of expectations that are out of whack from the get-go. My expectations at the beginning were that I might get lucky and get an academic job—any academic job. And then I got extremely lucky.
3817,depressed,Someone bring me chocolate I’m depressed and sad and everything hurts

3821,depressed,I hate that PCOS/PCOD as a disorder is talked about so little when the consequences can be so terrible and range from diabetes to infertility to depression and anxiety. So many women suffer from it and many even go their whole lives being undiagnosed because there isn’t awareness
3822,depressed,Every march I get depressed and close off and this one has been no different. I’ve just done it on a stage of sorts. Here. I go a little crazy and say and do things that I shouldn’t but I’m not apologizing. This is my way of handling the pain.

7523,cheerful,@Ze_AwEsOmE_Hobo Hmmmm tbh it would have to be to receive less damage. If you’re careless you can get hit 3/7 times in a row depending on the enemy because they’ll combo you. Carelessness even on normal enemies can get you kill instantly. That’s why it’s tough
7524,depressed,@DREWMALINO No!! You are human! We all make mistakes and feel dumb sometimes. But the fact is it's impossible to be perfect! It's impossible to go through life without making mistakes. You are trying even though you feel down and depressed. You still are trying! That's what matters.

7540,depressed,@Enviro_Doggo @Camellia_Alexan Doctors say the same thing. I've been to the doctor for depression. Getting sunlight healthy eating exercise are all things doctors promote for depression. And it's not like it's a secret.
7541,depressed,Just because I sit alone doesn’t mean I’m depressedI’m still happy but I enjoy my time more this way
7542,depressed,@Dedd_pepe Same to u n remove depression from ur lyf permanently JAZAK ALLAH

7544,depressed,@danirat Yes I am a big fan of naps. I take 15-20 minute power naps regularly and it's helped me significantly while juggling my day job and freelancing. Also if I have bad days I may take a nap as a coping mechanism for depression & anxiety.
7545,depressed,I am in a state of depression
7546,depressed,My neighbors are talking outside and it sounds like the girl is struggling with depression and her bf is telling her that “depression is fake. It’s made up. Happiness is a choice your depression is made up” blah blah blah. Girl if you’re reading this your man is uneducated.
7547,depressed,It’s hard for people to understand #agoraphobia  For those of you who get it... I rode in a car with someone new for the first time in about a decade. 🙌 It’s not life-changing but it could be the first steps toward that. 💁🏻‍♀️ #anxiety #exposuretherapy #depression
7548,depressed,Question why do some people fake depression or anxiety or joke about it

7550,depressed,@realDonaldTrump Oh my gosh I needed this laugh. Thinking about that poor girl who got into the wrong car and what that animal did to her has really depressed me. I can't imagine how scared she was and feel so horrible for her family. But I sure do love my president! @realDonaldTrump

7554,depressed,@MahinRyan @AndrewYang “Society” is not just government. Considering that depression has risen as wages have been stagnant for 40 years as well as amount of people who cannot make ends meet its safe to say that financial insecurity and poverty is the primary cause of our misery.
7555,depressed,comparing rent in SF and Chicago is making me depressed lol
7556,depressed,the smell of gasoline garbage and depression
7557,depressed,Damn I walk in the room without smiling and everyone thinks I’m going into a depressed downward spiral... like chill I just don’t feel like talking (to you)
7558,depressed,Tweeting about mental health after someone commits suicide but you won’t speak of the subject until it happens again. Making it look like you care when you have people in your life that deal with serious depression but do nothing. I’ve seen a lot of fake awareness on my timeline
7559,depressed,Hey @_Aphmau_ I dont know how bad your depression and other said mental illnesses are. But maybe this is way to detox. A loving family wonderful friends and a handsome husband. With babysets at a time you can get better over time. I love you ❤️

7579,sad,Never reply when you are angry.Never make a promise when you are happy.Never make a decision when you are sad.
7580,sad,@SonnyBunch To be fair I played Fortnite a good bit before it became popular and I played a little after it became popular: it shouldn’t be allowed anywhere. It’s a terrible game with a terrible player base that turned an amazing concept into a terrible free-to-play mode. Sad!
7581,sad,@crushveIvet more like sad flover months
7582,sad,@JW_Branding @AOC @realDonaldTrump Aahh so sad... now ur party is coming 4 U.  Ur green new bill will never become a reality since ur asking 4 a wealth tax to help pay 4 it.

7589,sad,I can be sad or I can realize that I deserve better for myself
7590,sad,@realDonaldTrump You and your son tweeting this out makes up for the sexual assault claims of 17 women made against you huh? What about the creepy positions you've put your daughter in over the years? Guess we should call him Joe Trump? Or how about Creepy Donnie Trump Lite? SAD!
7591,sad,Saying 'but the government spent £X amount on leaflets' really is a sad response to criminality. Breaking the law is immoral committing crimes is immoral. Justifying that by saying 'but the other side did this' is a value system I really can't wrap my head around. Shameful.
7592,sad,Sad & stressed

7601,sad,@Neiito_san It’s really sad sometimes...  our family has had a habit of taking in and rescuing a lot of animals. 😂My previous cat (may he rest in piece) was the runt of his litter and his mother outright abandoned him /left him for dead.He lived a long happy life and was a BIG CHONK
7602,sad,I’ve come to the conclusion that everyone needs @ATEEZofficial in their life. This is the first time in my life that I can still smile be happy for others getting to see them over being sad and miserable that I can’t see them. It’s utterly new and I love it.
7603,sad,@databyss @TheAtlasOne there's not really an okay way to get through it if that makes sense - i personally just went a bit numb while they talked i was given a new role and a bunch of people weren't there within a month and my department felt weird and sad and empty it's rough

7610,sad,@davelucas @BTS_twt Very true  bc @BTS_twt won in 2017 and they were ridiculed by kpop fandoms. That was very sad to witnessed  definitely BTS PAVED THE WAY for others. They literally made a path for others to follow.  No one had walked this path before .
7611,sad,@ParketLonnie @W7VOA @POTUS @seanhannity Putting it out there and letting them see how they look in the eyes of others they will realize oh shit i look like a fool maybe I should really step back think about the way I am conducting myself and change! But some are just too far gone make change and that's so so sad! 2/3

7614,sad,@Peter_Shilton @scottamylola So sorry that you are having to endure such nasty abuse. Take comfort in the fact that many millions are on your side. These are just vile comments from a sad  brain-dead tiny minority of Remain keyboard warriors who would never have the cojones to say this stuff to your face.

7618,sad,@fuzzleyan That's good o:I used to not care for them when I was a lot younger.. but now I really like them a lot. It probably helps that my ability to perceive its flavor isn't sad...
7619,sad,sometimes I think about the double standards for fic writers/fan artists in fandom and just get...sad? frustrated? the worst thing is it’s not an Us vs Them type situation. It’s frequently fic writers devaluing their own work bc it’s what we’ve been taught to do. Sighs.
7620,sad,Lmao tbh. This whole shit about racism that’s currently happening on twitter about Tulare has me weak. ALOT of you mfs that I went to high school with are definitely racist asf and it’s people that I never imagined it too be. Sad ass town
7621,sad,if they don’t film the first wembley date i‘ll be sad
7622,sad,"@JoeySalads Both sides do it Joey. Even though its definitely something that is sad to see its simply human nature to hate on the ""opponent"""
7623,sad,Pauli likes attention from EFF leadership the last pile of shit she wrote non of them responded she's sad. Today at @Radio702 she claimed they are scared cause of Karima Brown issue. EFF leadership lambasted Karima Brown no fear at all. EFF not scared of @SAEditorsForum too.

7626,sad,@lilserval I agree people 15+ should be given respect even 14+ Personally I've grown up far I'm far more mature than the other minors of my age.Now this isn't about nsfw but like some others said once people learn your age they treat you different it's sad to be honest.
7627,sad,I had a dream last night that I met @kailah_casillas at a party. She told me I was pretty and we hung out all night. Sad its not real 😭😭😭😭

If they had feature parity to Steam and used their Fortnite money to provide discounts to new games right at released and leveraged the free games lots of people would be thrilled to use their store.

8298,depressed,for some quiet isn't a choice. some days you are a stunned bird. crashing against a window with all your might unaware that your wings could never take you there. wings mean nothing when you fall into silent oblivion. depression can be like that. you just never see the glass.

8304,depressed,Sometimes when shit gets rough when you’re depressed af or when you just feel off for no reason.. GO SPEND TIME W/ YOURSELF. Srsly. It doesn’t even have to involve spending money. Go do something by yourself in order to heal yourself. ❣️
8305,depressed,I now have a strategy plan for if this ever happens to me again and I'm hoping it will help others as well. 1. there are reasons you're depressed. yes your neurochemicals are in a state of imbalance but that is not the cause. It's the outcome. there are so many causes.

8315,depressed,I told my dad i was depressed when i was 14 and he put me in therapy. I didn’t like my first therapist so he researched and found me another. He found supplements to help with anxiety and made me pill pouches with my antidepressants and supplements. Believe your kids. Help them.
8316,depressed,Having a toxic & manipulative mother is the root to all my insecurities & without a doubt my depression.
8317,depressed,@trrytea @CMillerTalks Do you disagree that your internal perspective of depression will influence how you feel? CBT for instance (which is effective for many) incorporates model-level intervention to treat depression anxiety etc.

8805,depressed,@drewamyers Truly have my student loan ID and password in there 😂 literally every single one besides the poem about depression 😂
8806,depressed,... for some of us it's far from tolerable on a daily basis. #Depression simple honest anger or outright rage complacency? None of these make #change. None. The change comes from facing those fears letting someone in who wants to and can help our lives be better. Change⤵️
8807,depressed,Im sorry for ranting but i am Beyond the point of stressed at the moment but also in a Very bad state of depression and this us the only way i can vent w/o feeling like im burdening my friends

8813,depressed,"You gotta realize what kind of soul you have. Don't get caught up thinking your soul is inherently human. Sometimes y'all might be depressed because nothing on earth gives you that feeling of ""home"" you might just be here to fulfill a mission and dip. This place is DENSE rn"

8815,depressed,People swear pregnancy is just carrying a baby and that’s it? A women’s body changes so much during those 9 months from physically to mentally. Some even go through Postpartum depression but this isn’t talked about enough.
8816,depressed,I hate to tweet something this petty but I made the decision to unsubscribe to @RiyadhK. I'm still blocked. It's been years.  I messaged him to thank him for making a video about depression and anxiety and then he blocked me. I still have no idea why. Anyone who does... (1/2)
8817,depressed,WTH? Kamala Harris: “[Trump] Has Caused A Lot Of Us To Go Through Individual And Group Therapy…To Feel Despair And Depression And Anxiety And Fear” (Video) –  THEN I CAN’T WAIT FOR 2020.
8818,depressed,I have opportunities and success so far! I have a husband who loves me and friends who care. I have a lovely home and a car that isn’t boring. I have I have I have. So why am I so anxious and depressed lately?
8819,depressed,3. Occasionally random people remind us that the gold standard caused the Great Depression. Some cannot quite articulate why. Others fail to consider whether this reflects a problem with central banks operating a gold standard or an inherent instability of the gold standard.
8820,depressed,I hate to be so without introductions to go to my bed and throw my body like a dead corpse and to be depressed all week I hate to sleep and dream of you.

8826,depressed,@VisionaryeMo @dgxptw @obvij If that was the case medication wouldn’t exist. If you think money material things or even other humans will make you less depressed you’re wrong. I had a picture perfect childhood no bad memories looking back. I have a great marriage and a beautiful kid. Depression is real.

8829,depressed,@ReasonRaccoon @AndrewYang As depression has risen has the government involvement in our lives gotten greater  or smaller? Does the answer to this question  also answer your question of what is wrong with our system?
8830,depressed,Helping other people will help you heal from #depression. It can be hard to get started when you're depressed or #anxious or both but persevere cos it's worth it! Raise $$$ for something join a cause do volunteer work or just support others who're depressed & anxious too. 
8831,depressed,Also if you think this admin is going to nominate anyone not committed to keeping the prime rate unduly depressed to artificially stimulate sluggish growth (thereby removing policy options to address the recession coming in the next 12-24 months) you're going to be disappointed.
8832,depressed,@jbfan911 LMAOOO he just blocked me cuz I said treatment resistant depression exists
8833,depressed,@greg_ip @TheStalwart The only argument for doing so is a status quo biased argument that we already do it so why try to do something better? Which I don't think is a very good argument and requires a mostly permanently depressed economy to work.

8839,depressed,@griever_07 @SupraHadouken @xblCrossy1986 @Jasong_757 @BeastFireTimdog You have serious mental and anger issues.You need help.  I'm serious.

8850,depressed,Why is everyone depressed
8851,depressed,When ever you tell someone that you have anxiety/depression/literally any issue related to mental health  they automatically assume it as a product of some fucking breakups or relationship issue. Aur bhi gaam hain zamanay may ishq or mohabbt k siwa chutioon 😒- Silly peeps
8852,depressed,The saddest testament to society is the mental acceptance of unwanted physical contact being labelled not so bad or not bad as rape. Instead of accepting that folks should respect people's personal boundaries. Seriously yall I am depressed I have to type this out.
8853,depressed,It's so annoying when you used to like people and they're virulent concerning MJ. And they also diss you indirectly about that.One of them made fun of my depression too. It's online friends but it hurts.

8865,depressed,@TonyM70 @PeoplesMomentum @UKLabour The government has a budget to spend based on forecasts of tax returns. Are you suggesting the government should have turned a recession into a depression by not borrowing money and leaving a 156bn hole in the already broken economy? You're obviously economically illiterate.

9644,sad,"@GaryBuh @Alex_EuphioEich You know the sad thing about making him an honorless monster? I genuinely enjoyed his ""old man who loves sake and is puppet-mastering political maneuvers from behind a Tengu mask"" humor in the game before that. Feels like a bit of character assassination in his own game."

9649,sad,@HenryKarlsonIII @andrea_manea @OLRefugeMonksCA And the sad thing is this is a monster the bishops themselves created which turned around and has consumed many of them. They chose to make her station the quasi-official USCCB t.v. channel placing way too much power in the hands of an egomaniac uneducated person.
9650,sad,For a community that’s supposed to be all about love and acceptance y’all sure really do love to bitch and moan about artists/festivals/songs when they aren’t exactly to your taste. It’s quite sad honestly and realistically why a lot of people are turned off by our community.

9655,sad,The story starts as most good stories start in a soul-destroying meeting in a room that smelled vaguely musty but not in a way you could really describe.Everybody in the meeting was sad. This wasn't just because of the pervasive smell of something-not-quite-healthy but2/

9690,depressed,shes done it before on my depression meds and i know she can do it again with things going on in her life
9691,depressed,"way now? It clearly makes no sense and Kawaii needs to at least explain was she even ""depressed"" or was she trying to get sympathy from her followers so she could get more attention. Oh and if you think I'm in the wrong here that's your opinion. Stop saying I'm ""begging for-"
9692,depressed,"anymore time than she did originally. My next point is that she randomly became ""depressed."" This could be completely false because this is the internet and you never know if she is telling the truth or not. She wasn't ""depressed"" from the beginning so why is she becoming this-"
9693,depressed,some common side effects of this depression medication may include severe fatigue nausea weight gain even worse depression bone spiders cactus ear tiny little thorns on your fingertips headaches
9694,depressed,I just want to know why we can be so happy and then within .2 seconds get so depressed and anxious!!! It’s not fun!!
9695,depressed,This morning I had the privilege to talk to VCA students about Ecofeminist Fridays 💧and Hacking the Anthropocene 🕷 we sat around a drop sheet drinking tea talking about mess and love depression anxiety (and more) as emotions that can be worked with as methodologies.
9696,depressed,im depressed and i miss starevo rejet part 88 
9697,depressed,Are you depressed? In danger of a heart attack? AI promises to figure that out and much more by listening to your voice.  via @WSJ
9698,depressed,I believe depression is first of all a heart issue. It stems from anxiety despair hurt and discouragement. We definitely need to keep guarding our hearts from these aches hard as it may be. They are definitely inevitable! #DepressionKe

9703,depressed,Fashion is a depressed business at its core but I wanna change that narrative
9704,depressed,having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired of the same time It’s the fear of failure but no urge to be productive. It’s wanting friends but hate socializing It’s wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. It feels everything at once so it’s like you numb
9705,depressed,Almost everyone who starts talking to me at airport bars seems depressed.

9714,depressed,Fighting depression is hard once you face that bully and win. You’ll forever be good.
9715,depressed,@MrsLuigiGalaxy You need to cut down the depression shit on Twitter. It's a bad public image. Go on antidepressants. They take a few weeks to kick in but change life drastically. You'll still feel depressed but not for as long as usual. I'm bipolar depression and I only experience suidide seldom
9716,depressed,@HopeWithinChaos @AngryJoeShow I laughed and then I got very depressed.
9717,depressed,At some point I was in deep depression in my life and I didn't know about kpop yet. There's this one artist who literally saved my life and gave me enough anger to keep going... I've been listening to his songs for the past hour and I haven't heard them since my depression. Wow.
9718,depressed,@GameEnders_ @Enviro_Doggo @Camellia_Alexan Honestly a better wording for the original tweet as to prevent debates like this could be “some might find the following practices beneficial to dealing with their depression” or “while some are dependent on pills it’s always good to talk to a doctor...”
9719,depressed,If you were in my shoes you’ll know my pain and depression
9720,depressed,Exams itne qareeb hai ke ab depressed hone ka bhi waqt nhi hai

9821,sad,Since a young age I've always been the type of person to wait around all day for that phone call or message or just situation in general to come knowing it never would.  Sometimes it pertained to my dad or someone I lost even people who died.  Kinda sad lmao.

9823,sad,@TheVietGwent Again. A 1 eyed view of the ‘Cardiff’ issue that clearly grates so deep for you. I love the niggle that exists within welsh rugby amongst the regions where we want to beat each other but to hate a region/club for your own issues is quite sad Geraint. I hope you get over this soon

9829,sad,@noah_coble @ItsEnergie @FortniteBR You fucking loser. Go outside for once instead of watching sad simpsons edits you nerd.
9830,sad,@Susan_Hennessey @AdamParkhomenko This is in a nutshell why politically correct nutcases (apparently like yourself) need to be taught (apparently) about why your opinions and feelings about just about anything don't matter. Because you aren't smart enough to realize why they don't matter. It's quite sad.
9831,sad,@AnaKasparian Ana you are a sad and ridiculous person. I used to consider you a fair person until you started smearing Tulsi. You are pathetic.

9849,sad,@PaulHRosenberg @Sandwichman_eh what's sad is that people need to believe that Trump is an agent of the Russians. they're dupes for BS put out by the corporate media and the Clinton campaign. It was a shock that Trump was elected and it broke a lot of people's brains.

9863,sad,@TheFuture1210 Then why you always posting dumb sad shit??
9864,sad,The sad truth not everyone will be there for us when we need them. The good news it doesn’t really matter. We learn to tough it out and just be close with the people who really love us who’ll accept us even when we are not that lovable.
9865,sad,@FBILouisville @FBICincinnati @AuroraPoliceIL @CincyPD Damn it I was hoping it was him. I have so many questions. So sad.

9871,sad,@GOPLeader @LindaSuhler Very sad indeed. The cock did crow 3 times at the DNC convention which you needed an ID to attend. They even required ID protesters to show ID. We see their true identity. Shameful.

9880,sad,@ChuckWendig Not sure why this article from 2014 is going around again. It was notable when it was first published too. So sad for the dolphins. The lead research guy Lilly was in it for the notoriety rather than rigorous science.
9881,sad,@SpillerOfTea I feel that way a lot. Please just be careful. I think you're a lovely caring person and I would be so sad if you got ill.

9892,sad,@billshortenmp Yeah I get it Shorten I’ve lost 3 people to cancer. It’s sad and upsetting but what you are doing is playing the classic MISERY PORN card. It’s indefensible makes you look like a hero and grabs voters by the guilt trip. It’s cruel it’s cunning and very Machiavellian.

9905,sad,@AbrahamOnMoney When you see how few advisers contribute to consultations you can understand why regulation is not fuelling professionalism. I’m not sure many even understand our role or where the value sits. Since Collette Bowe they have favoured consolidation over building a profession so sad
9906,sad,What a sad sad world.
9907,sad,@RealSaavedra The truth of the matter is that little girl is a victim of her parents most likely feeding her that nonsense. Trump was referring to ILLEGAL immigrants who run drugs into our country not legal Mexican immigrants. So sad how the left actively abuses their children.

9914,sad,@bastylefilegirl @lincolnwrites @shadowandact I also loved Pitch and was sad to see it axed after just one season. I also love The Passage but I'm struggling to figure out how MPG would figure into a second season given how the first ended. In fact whatever would the second season even be?

9927,sad,So sad to hear that the Atlanta Legendary Promotions was canceled.  I was so looking forward to coming by and saying hi and getting a @RealDeanCain hug.😭
9928,sad,@realDonaldTrump I think it's sad and pathetic how people can sit around and put people down and call them names when they're no better themselves it's amazing the world that we live in today can't trust nobody and everybody wants everything to benefit themselves there is no respect anymore
9929,sad,i hate being hated by everyone it’s so sad for me

9940,depressed,@QuabbityAshwitz Dude seems seriously depressed... 🤦‍♂️& terribly misinformed...if you think a doctor wants you to OVERCOME depression then you don’t understand how much $$$ they make pushing medication... all they want r repeat customers. Also human beings thrived for millennia without “doctors”

9951,depressed,Smoking weed has helped me with my depression a lot .. some ppl simply can’t understand it
9952,depressed,@GilletteVenus (Continued)One person lost her gained weight just by going off the med and that's why she gave up on that med but it was her depression med.So when you say 'give up the thing that makes you fat' it might be a medication not food and this is becoming more common.
9953,depressed,| MUCH NEEDED TALK |I've realised that I suffered from depression at an age I didn't even care to know what it was all about. I just knew that something was wrong with me but I didn't have anyone to talk to me about it. Even if I had I didn't know what to say-
9954,depressed,You’re honestly so shitty if you make someone feel bad for being depressed. Don’t speak on what you don’t understand.
9955,depressed,I want to just up and move from the area where I live but my wife doesn't. I feel trapped and it's a huge key to my depression. Sucks

9963,depressed,lol i hope my friends know that when i’m severely depressed i lash out and say things i don’t really mean 
9964,depressed,@simon3862 No. I always got severe depression anxiety and OCD. I've also had 'narcissistic personality disorder' and all sorts It's a bullshit form to go through the motions. Ignore the numbers and just focus on changing your destructive behaviours going forward.
9965,depressed,@AdaVox Ada I have spent my entire adult life battling depression. I absolutely felt every minute of this. Real and inspiring. If you ever need to talk or vent to an old broad with nothing to gain who completely gets it please reach out to me. Truly I am here for you. U R beautiful.

9972,depressed,@Syedamariam3 The coolest thing is that you did not let depression anxiety stress fear and people stomp you over. the coolest thing is you became a bit braver stronger and smarter. Stay blessed sis
9973,depressed,@ColleenB123 hi :) my depression has been bad lately and i just wanted to say thank you for making me smile everyday. i love you so much
9974,depressed,@Cryyfuu I only just after nearly 29 years of existing accepted and discovered something about myself that really would've probably changed my entire life up until this point relating to depression etc. So no worries getting lost is going to happen and eventually you will hit land again
9975,depressed,There's nothing comical about Britney Spears going into a mental health rehab. She's strong enough to admit she need help. Plus she's very responsible by taking action because she has children. Depression is serious and it can be draining and deadly. Certain things are not jokes.
9976,overjoyed,@ecstatic_gamer @drlevelup I've been saving up for awhile. I'm so excited 😭

It’s certainly not the Golden Age of ⚾️ . I guess players should be ecstatic when a hitter fails 75% of the time.
9997,overjoyed,I’m sure Mr. Putin is ecstatic about Mr Cain joining the fed.Tearing down those institutions.With McConnels support.History won’t be kind.
9998,overjoyed,@LetDrewCook @DavidKlion @MotherJones @tcraggs22 Beyond that his campaign met in Trump Tower with russian representatives explicitly to seek their help in the election and Roger Stone contacted wikileaks to get access to the DNC hack. All this apparently wasn't illegal and Glen and Tracey are ecstatic about it.
9999,overjoyed,I remember in years past the #Yankees were always late starters. The team didn't really get rolling until June. Not thrilled with them dropping both series at the Stadium but I'm over it. I was there for the 2 wins. Maybe I should go to more games 🤔 (It's 6 games out of 162)

10006,overjoyed,@SanguMandanna @seananmcguire It's not the same but I devoured those weird fetish-y books about sick kids dying because they were the only books I found where kids were allowed to be in pain all the time. 😕 I think I have a tiny inkling of it and I'm thrilled that you're giving more kids a fictional mirror
10007,overjoyed,@JoeBiden I am a Scottish citizen. And Sir we in the 'United' Kingdom not very united at the moment we be thrilled to have you as a Prime Minister!

10595,sad,@supermathskid @DailyPedantry @Arekkusanda @LindsayPB Get a job elsewhere! I moved to the US (Detroit area) because it was cheaper and easier to make a living here than in Austria. Get to see my family once a year. It is sad but it is the choice I made. Sure there are nicer places to live but that is life.
10596,sad,I'm tired and sad and hungry which means I have no energy or desire to make food even though my stomach evidently wants it.
10597,sad,@Serremmy @Taipan30 If I lived in NY I would be totally embarrassed my state actually put this idiot in office.  I see there is a decent crowd of morons in the room as well.  Pretty sad there are so many indoctrinated people in America.

10919,suicidal,This desperately sad story makes me so angry. Who the hell are the scumbags working in schools that carry out this shameful punishment on autistic kids? Name and shame the lot of them and good on the mum for sueing our inept government.😡
10920,suicidal,Columbus:• cut off Native Americans' hands if they did not collect enough gold• tortured and raped women both his own and Native Americans• beheaded Native Americans for fun• forced 50000+ Native Americans to commit mass suicide• had underage girls sold into sex trade

10922,suicidal,@Bianca_upe I tell my sisters to take it back to their room and bring it when I'm done. I cant kill myself😌
10923,suicidal,Yes I've attempted suicide. Yes it's a common thought for me.No I'm not selfish.Saying to someone who is considering suicide or has attempted it or even managed suicide is selfish because of that only adds to the problem. It does not fix it.Think before you speak.
10924,suicidal,@lisarinna Very poor taste in a country where thousands are dying each year from addiction and suicide. Enjoy poking fun at yourself by being immature and making light of a serious issue. You've been a horrible person this year.
10925,suicidal,Now are we sure #TimmothyPitzen mom Amy really committed suicide?  Just making sure she wasn’t murdered. I know there was a note left behind and she battled depression.
10926,suicidal,‘Shocking’ NHS stats show nearly half ESA claimants have attempted suicide 
10927,suicidal,@Jude_Houdini Have you ever sat down and thought that depressed people don’t want to show their symptoms due to stigma like you’re putting on suicide and depression? So many people are told to “get over it” and “it’ll be okay” when they’re expressing their symptoms before suicide.
10928,suicidal,@davehope80 Hugs. Whenever I feel like this I always remind myself that I decided to bring my children into the world so I need to be there for them as they are my priority. Losing a parent to suicide was not a great time of my life I would never conflict that on my kids no matter what.

10930,suicidal,We have always known that @KellyKhumaloZA is a member of ANC. The decision to book her demonstrated that artists must not be victimized for their political affiliation. #EFF is above pettiness and will always set good examples. She must commit career suicide without us.

10946,sad,@UkipExeter This just goes to prove the very point he was making - we lack decent civilised conversation & resort to mud slinging. He was entirely respectful of those who voted leave. He talked about empathy & kindness - it's sad to see people unable to extend those values.

11097,suicidal,Apparently you can't listen to nsbm  without being a nazi. The argument in that is not even worth the effort. If you listen to dsbm make sure to kill yourself too because you have to be depressed or suicidal to listen to that too right? Haha these kids make for good humour.

13539,suicidal,rebranding as someone who isnt suicidal
13540,suicidal,@ScribeUndead So... should this guy be on suicide watch?
13541,suicidal,Ow jealousy is a disease.A 28 year old man this morning committed suicide because he suspected his wife was cheating on him.He later murdered her but unfortunately on his part he was arrested. It happened in my house. .👅👅👅🙊🙊💪👊👊🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃#Offline
13542,suicidal,Being fat and poor is a suicide mission 😌...you’ll be hungry 😋 and people won’t believe you😂🤣
13543,suicidal,Lgbt people commit suicide as a direct result of the church bullying them telling them telling them they are sinning bc they love someone of the same sex as them and cant be a member of the church and gay at the same time
13544,suicidal,I believe that we are our patients advocate first and foremost. We need to hold onto the hope when they cannot. @WeNurses #WeNurses'The nurse is temporarily the consciousness of the unconscious the love of life for the suicidal' - Virginia Henderson

13756,depressed,"@clandestinewing Sorry I went to sleep after I liked your tweet. Anyways I have to say that depression isn't that simple to just try and get better. People with depression don't ""wallow"" in it. Depression can destroy the strength to keep fighting. Depressed people don't want to be depressed."
13757,depressed,@oorgustus Smh... You do realize depression is real and can affect her right? Because of you internet trolls. What a world! Sigh !!!
13758,depressed,@TheBubbleBubble That's some crazy fear mongering. Even during the great depression when unemployment was 25% there was no societal collapse. Japan has a debt to GDP ratio north of 200% and it hasn't collapsed. US is around 100%. Sure there could be a recession or slower growth but this is insane
13759,depressed,My seasonal depression is coming to an end y’all!!!
13760,depressed,but i am getting better. i made some huge accomplishments but my brain glosses over them bc thats what depressed brains are wired to do. thats REALLY UNHELPFUL bc you *have* to celebrate the good intentionally on purpose to change your brain

13764,depressed,Cats fr saved my life and cured my depression I wish I was joking
13765,depressed,@LilyMiranda07 Didn’t even consider Kevin moving back to be closer. Makes sense. As far as Katoby goes they’re either implying a split/divorce throwing us off again OR Toby is knee deep back in depression mode and they’re just arriving separately. I lean towards the latter.
13766,depressed,Cigarettes always save you from depression anxiety stress.

13775,depressed,So the hilarious thing about depression is that it follows you across state lines. Tennessee NY- doesn’t matter! It’s in the backseat wherever you go. Us millennials don’t call it “failing” we call it “taking time off to work on our mental health”

13822,depressed,@brokeymcpoverty I feel all of this HARD (cyclical depression yay) and that’s the best explanation I’ve read for how weird CBT feels. Unnatural.

14382,suicidal,I love Joaquin Phoenix and I'm way too excited for the #JokerMovie but I thought Jared Leto would star in it. I loved him in Suicide Squad. He Will Smith and Margot Robbie were the best part of that movie.
14383,suicidal,@kunalkamra88 @ShekharGupta He should be zipped and chained for his own protection. The guy has suicidal tendencies.

14398,suicidal,@2BePrepared Obviously you can’t pinpoint the suicides to one specific act. But anyone who says that the attitude towards our lgbtqia siblings within the church aren’t harmful triggering and partially if not solely responsible for the increasing rates of suicide within the church is blind

A lot of cash is for earnings credit/no interest.

14865,depressed,@Mannerbunde @alexei71621488 @rooshv Pretending you know me or my sense of self isn't an argument. Being blackpilled isn't like depression it's more nuanced than that. Like I said its a full acceptance of the realization that western civilization is dying. To not accept that is to cope. Now argue against that.

14967,depressed,goodnight i feel so depressed ifs exhausting
14968,depressed,@MrKleptonic @Camellia_Alexan You’re phrasing in your original tweet created the impression that you find it ridiculous that medication would help with mental illness. Additionally depression doesn’t necessarily require a tangible issue in life to manifest.
14969,depressed,@UlricaLoeb No competent mental health care professional (myself included) would deny the question of co-morbidity but it is a chicken-or-the-egg problem. Does the depression/anxiety/eating disorder stem from experiencing gender dysphoria? Or should they be treated first?
14970,depressed,That's what in philosophy is known as lat. recta voluntas rightful will. A will that's guided by reason in the light of truth (reality). Depression at some point may contaminate your reasoning and will making you believe that dying is the best option. Don't fall into such trap.
14971,depressed,@theGeekSheek @GilletteVenus Not necessarily I meant for the already slightly overweight they get depressed that their efforts aren't working and comments they heard and then go on a med that puts on more.
14972,depressed,someone in one of my grp chats thought depression is seasonal... tf
14973,depressed,Put my depression in this drank so I pour two cups
14974,depressed,Declare anxiety and depression powerless in your life! ⚔️Rise up!Begin again.Believe again.Dream again.

14976,depressed,@OmarGoshTV Amen brotha. I just lost my brother yesterday to depression and want to put it out there that mental health is a serious issue. If your not happy with who you are then make some changes because nobody can make you truly happy except yourself. God bless everyone
14977,depressed,Me: depressedGod: 
14978,depressed,Thinking about how I hooked up with my literal wet dream of a man and when I asked him to hangout a couple of days later he sent me a long message about how he really wants to hangout and be friends but he’s really depressed & not in a good place to date seriously

14981,depressed,Feeling glad and relieved but hurt and depressed this is even a thing to be glad about at the same time.  
14982,depressed,@ModeledBehavior People always over learn the lesson of their youth. The leaders of the Fed in the late 60s and 70s came of age in the Great Depression and over learned those lessons. Just as Boomers over learned the lessons of the 70s.

15011,happy,@JB_AU Totally agree. But in the first instance the government  should throw money at training more. There is a massive national shortage of AUSLAN interpreters. Sometimes we struggle for events. (Part of this is driven by many more orgs using them regularly which is great.)

15330,happy,@_BeanEnthusiast @kellydigges @AnEnemySpy I feel strongly that that novella was probably made under pretty savage constraints and I don’t want to disparage the creative work there... but as someone who hadn’t read Magic lore since the Weatherlight it wasn’t a great reintroduction.

15378,happy,"Getting good grades and being an overachiever from a young age kinda sucks.Now when I do anything good or great its just expected of me instead of praised. I can be happy about my grade and then try to share that and its always ""Well ofc"" or ""thats what you're supposed to do"""
15379,happy,"Some royal asshole in britain saying ""fortnite is designed to addict"" is the best summation of ""the worst person you know just made a great point"""
15380,happy,I read that being ignored activates the same parts of the brain as being physically in pain.That's why people here on Twitter go to great lengths to insult those who block.They're literally hurt about being actively ignored. It's like watching unloved kids throw tantrums.
15381,happy,A great combo and some amazing vibes will really do you some good 😅
15382,happy,@xi69i1 Happy birthday sweetie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

15406,overjoyed,I feel elated right now.What are you waiting for? Let's make your dream come true! 
15407,overjoyed,"This means people-pleasers can be drawn to relationships that are controlling (they feel safest when they defer to others) emotionally-withholding (they are driven by the need to ""secure"" affection/elated when they do) and even abusive (their lack of boundaries is exploited)."
15408,overjoyed,@realDonaldTrump Learning how to spell while appropriately capitalizing and punctuating sentences would satisfy me a little sir.But really- Just you resigning would make me ecstatic!
15409,overjoyed,Simply overjoyed to hear your good news. @BTS_twt #BTSBillboardTopGroup
15410,overjoyed,Overjoyed
15411,overjoyed,@realDonaldTrump I can think of two things that would make this Dem ecstatic. 1. #ReleaseTheFullMuellerReportNOW 2. RESIGN.
15412,overjoyed,@maydaymindy9 Ha! Ha!. His peeps are all lining up for the BIG SHOW tonight in Grand Rapids. They're thrilled to death. And DeVos slashes the education budget insuring we preserve a significant minority of uneducated  voters.
15413,overjoyed,@DUALIPA @nilerodgers I love your music and I thrilled about your upcoming music!
15414,overjoyed,"@realDonaldTrump DEMOCRATS TELL TRUMP IT'S SIMPLE - 'GIVE US YOUR RESIGNATION LETTER'. Nancy Pelosi responded to the President's accusation that he can't do anything to make Democrats happy. ""Turn in you resignation you big fat lying loser and we'll be ecstatic!"" Trump is despised everywhere."

15417,overjoyed,@fundstrat @BeckyQuick @Bitcoin Have some @GBTC I'm ecstatic to have right now.  But felt past coverage particularly on Fast Money at the highs was somewhat 'loose'. Live in NYC but run small investing club for struggling neighbors in upstate NY & some of them took it way more literal than you intended!
15418,overjoyed,@realDonaldTrump There is ONE thing and ONE THING ONLY that will make every Democrat (and probably millions of Republicans) happy well let's rephrase and say ECSTATIC and that would be for YOU to TENDER YOUR RESIGNATION TODAY! Think about it... 🤞

15422,overjoyed,@rideox4 You guys are a gift that keeps giving. Thank you so much for all of your hard work! I'm ecstatic!
15423,overjoyed,@ChrisMuellerPGH Yes you have a right expect four wins.  But they are not guaranteed. And you are looking at this from only one team's perspective.  St. Louis fans no doubt are ecstatic about their team's `come-from-behind' ability and not even thinking of bullpen collapse.
15424,overjoyed,We are elated to be finalists for so many awards already this year. These awards acknowledge the quality of care provided by our franchise teams & the success of our franchise model. We are immensely proud to champion quality care & promote what fantastic #franchising looks like.

15437,happy,"Secret Service has one mission: protect the president. But when Trump is at his clubs Secret Service also has to keep his customers happy so he can profit off them. That's a misuse of gov't resources and makes Mar-a-Lago a ""gold mine"" for foreign spies. "

15439,happy,@timpayton @The_Arsenal_ @Envizage @ftballDNA I’m not a financial expert but I lived the fear of losing good players and our loan situation wasn’t great and we became a club focussed on the bottom line due to our infrastructure ambition That’s what I saw - if I missed an alternative I apologise

15734,sad,6. What I am saying scares me since as a lawyer I know how crazy it is to even think a judge could be corrupt. But these are sad times in our national history and it appears we do not have men of courage in our professions to speak the truth and stand by it. If we are to sanitise

Just sad
15746,sad,@Milbank Dana you disappoint!  You show your bias against Bernie with no credible evidence of his wrongdoing.  As a journalist you’re supposed to be unbiased but you can’t contain yourself and speak truth to your own hypocrisy.  So sad...

15752,sad,@Mimirocah1 @SethAbramson I agree Mimi it *is* sad. His 19 page audition refusal to recuse & the way he phrased his answer on whether he’d release Mueller’s report or not gave us ALL an enormous amount of doubt. I personally thought tho that his “friendship” w/ Mueller would have kept him legit.
15753,sad,@MundeleinSem @FrRyanRojo He says he’ll always tell the truth...yeah...like when he withheld the letter from Cardinal Ratzinger together with uncle ted explaining that the bishops must apply canon 915 against pro abortion politicians...he also tainted by omission in not speaking up about uncle ted... Sad.

15776,sad,@LawrenceBJones3 @FoxNews Nice touch to fan the flames of the idiots that watch your propaganda. How fucking sad you’ve sold your soul. Lived in Texas my whole life. You don’t need a car at the border. You’d need it for a march by fat bloated gun porn idiots at the capital. #foxisafraud

17491,happy,"@Hauwi_Moeti @Uzalo_SABC1 Turning the good doctor into his father was a great idea for @uzalo... But I just wish they could bring something new in the ""ntsizwe scene"""
17492,happy,"Some GOP senators not willing to weigh in yet on Cain helping guide central banking system of U.S. Romney declined to comment saying he wants to find out more.Roy Blunt=no comment.But David Perdue who's on Banking cmte backs Cain. ""A great addition"" he told @StevenTDennis."
17493,depressed,@guavacoochi Those days are so fucking hard. That thought pattern can feel. Dry convincing and the low blood sugar just reinforces the depression. Sending you peaceful thoughts: you deserve wonderful things (and food!)
17494,depressed,For me my biggest struggle is battling anxiety and depression to keep creating when I just want to cave in and stay in the shower all day. And what always always always motivates me is hearing that I have a positive influence on other people's life. ❤️
17495,depressed,@SwooshboyJay you fuckin right gotta stop bein a depressed bitch
17496,depressed,actually now I have a nice group of friends AND depression!!
17497,depressed,I think I need to include depression in my budget.I get depressed and dont want to/can't bring myself to cook. Which means eating out. I always end up going over budget. I'll end up doing it again today. I cant afford my own hang ups... literally.
17498,depressed,Depressed Leo energy 
17499,depressed,I'm so tired of having depression lol at this point its just........boring and trying new anti depressants is just dreadful
17500,depressed,depression is when you don’t really care about anything. anxiety is when you care too much and over think everything. having both is hell.
17501,depressed,I feel a little better today with my meds - i mean work is easier. When I get really depressed my desire to work is the last thing to go. And I was getting pretty bad there for a few weeks but now I feel like the meds are kicking in. i feel like i can do my work again
17502,depressed,@Exodothatshit I loved being depressed it was so awesome wish I could go back

17510,depressed,@katiepeheakoe Wait a minute I saw his dad literally stand  up to the FLQ. They were throwing bottles at him  he ducked but stood up right away to face them . Don't knock our dads. They  fought the depression and 2 world wars. Justin is a sick pos compared to his dad.
17511,depressed,today i was sent to the doctors (by school order) and i got tested for depression and anxiety. they diagnosed me with moderate-severe depression and they put me on antidepressants and i’m being sent to weekly therapy. i just felt like you guys should know incase i seem a little-

Just trying to ridicule you into being cured. Might not work but I tried. I don't fucking play Apex either!
17516,depressed,So why send depression not blessings ?
17517,depressed,I be happy as shit seeing my friends start families moe that shit is beautiful. I’d be depressed if I found out I had a kid on the way.
17518,depressed,find yourself a person who will bring you a glass of water when you wake up fromDepression Naps because they know how dehydrating it is to be Sad™
17519,depressed,@ainyuni23 The next day I woke up He's gone. I littrely cried I said I was sorry if I was bad at taking care of him I blame myself. I was depressed I didn't eat for a week and I locked myself in my room. It took me a few month to be okay.

17532,sad,It is sad when people fabricate stuff to get attention!
17533,sad,@trayNTP @ggreenwald That ppl can say that with a straight face in tbe context of everything known is just a sad commentary about them...but I get the need to believe Trump isn't a congenital criminal or whatever would mean less shit to fling at Democrats. It's a pathology I get that. It happens.

17553,sad,@TimidityHook [◘] : Shame when they just can't give us a chance. I personally just love writing SLs both casual and serious without a drop of lewd in them. Sad when we can't flaunt that side of our accounts.But--at the end of the day--you can't please everyone I guess.
17554,sad,@Kreilly65 @MrMcmurderer @mattschneidman And yes it is very sad that these things happen but you can’t just make it a race thing bro. The police are brutal to everybody They fucking hate everybody stop making this political

17568,sad,@WAVYBlNT @thiqabi There’s a particular ratio of waist to hip that is physically impossible naturally or insanely unhealthy which we see on Instagram. I’m aware curvy girls exist. I’m kinda sad that you’re trying to discredit what I said
17569,sad,@2sanskaari Yeah I have the same issue. Also they're stringy and don't dry quick and I hate the sticky feeling on my lips. I really loved the shades but this is sad 💔

17584,sad,The sad truth is Netflix can raise prices however much they want. People will get mad but they will still get new subscribers. And a year from now the current prices will be a bargain..
17585,sad,@Golfcharlie232 So very sad to read. RIP to all souls on board.

17599,sad,The #MeToo movement is a well calculated campaign to further isolate and dominate the boy child. A woman touches even your groin and you are required to appreciate the gesture. Now they are hunting influential men and silencing them. Sad!!!

17602,sad,i really don’t give no fcks anymore & I ain’t going to lie it’s kind of sad but idc
17603,sad,Computational journalism != data journalism. Infosec research and reporting is just as valid a form of computational journalism. It makes me sad when I see j-schools build out entire programs around the former while completely ignoring the latter.
17604,sad,sad-girl-folky-pop is my jam rn not happy about it but it’s happening

17607,sad,Sad eyesfake smile..
17608,sad,@MattRacquet This 'dumbing down'  of tennis will be I am afraid the beginning of the end of the tennis that I know and love. Very sad that everything has to be reduced to a quick fix which is usually a remedy that is temporary and illusory.
17609,sad,Sad that the African restaurants are all 25+ miles away lol
17610,sad,@LonelyGoomba I'll say not kinda really sorta to it's engine switch during development but mainly Disney shoving their foot all in it ain't surprising the Levels aren't too interesting the toy story one was cool just short to the Disney summons are very spamm lasty sad no Star wars anything

17618,sad,Sad that I can't even imagine what it would be like to be believed.. I'd faint and cry really hard.
17619,sad,It's so sad how people can be absolutely stuck in their ways and doubt you when you say things have to be one way when they think it can be another. Ffs... Sorry for the weird grammar btw
17620,sad,@janewildexxx It’s always nice that people try to help but to be honest. Your question requires so much more knowledge about you that any of our answers could just as well be bad ideas as they could be good. Ask your therapist for help is the best advice. I’m sorry you’re feeling sad.

17629,sad,@nzJayZee Don’t. You don’t need it. You know what’s in there. You’ll become more angry & more desperately sad.
17630,sad,@realDonaldTrump Dont you mean nightmare? But ok...a nightmare is a dream too. Still waiting for your Resignation Tweet. That would make the U.S. really great an the world a bit safer and better again. You can do it. So sad: Twitter will not be the same..after you resigned. Soo boring
17631,sad,Lost to Artur and Konsti pretty badly again yay.I hate Melee. Had fun the entire tournament but now it just feels sad. Losing to the same bunch of guys for years now and it's REAAAALLY getting oldI would like to improve. But maybe it's too late. I need like a year to Catch up

17635,sad,@MikeDBears34 @Ejayjones3 @pellepelle_10 @Antdizzle567 With that being said ... there are crimes where whites kill whites browns kill browns. Its usually a neighborhood thing of their own. This whole world is sad that people cant see eye to eye on anything. Twitter accomplishes nothing. Face to face dialogue is how it happens.
17636,sad,Some people really dont know how to dress appropriately for interviews and it’s actually sad.

17651,sad,I really like Nadine Lustre to play the role of Darna now. She really fits in the character a true Filipina beauty the body and the attitude. It's just so sad that she will never get that role I think because she's a Viva artist not star magic. #Darna
17652,sad,Sad & Ugly
17653,sad,@MkulimaMdogo So sad indeed for Kenya
17654,sad,Art should make you feel happy. Art should make you feel sad. Art should make you feel uncomfortable horrified angry - every imaginable emotion. Inciting moral panic over art's potential repercussions is cowardly.

17662,sad,@ladeyday @MichelleLavoie @Sal_Robins @thomaskaine5 Instead we wait til they run for office go to the media and then complain when they say they will be better saying that’s not good enough all while electing someone who has behaviors which are even more questionable.

17846,sad,@RiotDragonX @Shabbernigdo Your narrow view of the world is extremely sad.I treat all racism as racism because it is racism to discriminate/hate/have bigotry based solely on race.If you believe that a global minority of people are safe/protected everywhere in the world you are blind to reality.

That he doesn’t think as he’s told to think by racist liberals like yourself. You like many on the left are obsessed with race and controlling poc in how they think and vote.

17990,sad,@kimnamchi It’s really sad tbh. Like whether it was 100% the stylist’s choice or not it’s still appropriation. But fans still refuse to see the truth about how many black people can’t even wear that style in public places without backlash.

I argue that this game is the most accessible

19766,overjoyed,@theveganparent It’s a reasonable question. When I first heard about the impossible burger I was thrilled then I learned about the animal testing and my concern is not only for the animals but what the F is in it that we could not just assume it was safe for humans?

19839,suicidal,@KitterEm i got so close to making a suicide joke but i wont
19840,suicidal,  The real accomplices of Christchurch murderer are not those who sounded the alarm about Muslim immigration to the West but those in the West who embrace this passive submission weakness and cultural suicide and refuse to see the potential storms ahead.

19854,suicidal,How to commit suicide in Halal way?
19855,suicidal,@BigHossACS @tinye5488 @ChurchNewsroom @Fox92Terrell @poetickate I've heard from people who have lost loved ones to suicide in part due to this policy. I'm not claiming it was the only factor. That would be ridiculous. I'm saying it combined with unsympathetic attitudes pushed people further down the path of suicide. Some all the way.
19856,suicidal,@DrEllaC @rosie301071 @JacquiDillon @NHSEngland It was me that didn’t want to take the police process further as although the man had previous assaults etc he was obviously very poorly and had been put in the wrong place. He was extremely suicidal and all over the place. They let him down too

19859,suicidal,I’ve seen a lot of talk about suicide this weekend and a lot of “call a hotline”. Which is absolutely one good solution. But as someone who has been down this road many times myself I know it’s not that simple. So here’s a thread for folks struggling with suicidal thoughts:
19860,suicidal,I thought Joker was gonna have the actors from suicide squad 😞
19861,suicidal,Abused males have twelve times the normal suicide rate and go on to have higher rates of mental illness.  Though dialogue is beginning to occur the lack of discussion surrounding abuse of males has left an untold number to suffer in silence.
19862,suicidal,@catiesherm @_MANDONNA_ @KyleRichards What! Lisa looked shocked and really hurt! You people are just amazing did you also like Lisa being ganged up on all season after dealing with her brother's suicide. I just can't with you people!
19863,suicidal,I hate starting shit but honestly i felt it had to be pointed out bc no one had..suicide is serious and ive struggled with thoughts of wanting to end my life and just because its crack rp doesnt mean you should play it off as no big deal
19864,suicidal,@afunshoJ It’s  many people are committing suicide with it.
19865,suicidal,After all this its looks like other Drs agree hormones for this teen female are the only way forward. No ethics no morals no care for the well-being of the child. Children learning how to manipulate their parents with suicide threats FROM THIER THERAPIST? Fucking deplorable

19867,suicidal,@sltrib Things that make you go hmmmmm?  Perhaps Heaven really is like it is here on earth and even the creator hits a bogey now and then.   On the positive side of this I sincerely hope it eases the suicide issues that this stance exacerbated.  Everyone needs to feel loved and accepted
19868,suicidal,@annecater Ok. My Son in Law ran over 110 miles last weekend. Not flat miles. Miles up and down Wainwrights over 2500ft. 62 of them. Brief rest stops no proper sleep. Why? To raise awareness of young adults at risk of suicide. He raised over £1500 (nearly £2k with Gift Aid) for Papyrus.
19869,suicidal,@heathermalin @Doug_Lemov I'm sorry but I have to object. Your statement is irresponsible. Kids don't commit suicide because of homework. They commit suicide because of mental illness.
19870,suicidal,@huntiepooh All I asked was for him to stop hmu & that my Miami plans were none of his concern. Him telling me to kill myself after that was outta line

19876,suicidal,@Steffi__95 I know what you mean. There's no going back. Suicide is permanent. The person's mind must be tortured. Often the triggers and thoughts of the person are kept well hid from everyone else. It's the folk left behind who are v often left searching for answers too. Horrible.

19886,happy,@AksdalLauren I’m sorry it evokes those emotions for you. If it helps the song is about closure. The last like isn’t “if you care” it’s “take care for me”.

20137,sad,@kathiebennett That's all it is... Lies and slurs to prevent a Corbyn led government. It's sad to think the man who has campaigned all his life against all forms of racism is being lied about by people organisations and a MSM all with an agenda. He'd actually be better for everyone.

20523,depressed,PSA: if you’re depressed... let your friends help you out. Let your family in. Stop being such a martyr and let people HELP YOU. That’s what relationships are about. Otherwise you’re just a pity case. Change my mind.
20524,depressed,@theGeekSheek @GilletteVenus My point being that I have met multiple people who were trying hard to be healthy and it was still very difficult to lose weight.Sometimes that in itself doesn't help their depression then vicious circle they take Paxil or another med and gain weight.

21357,sad,@Dark_Derek Cheers Justin. I used to spend a lot of time in Brighton. Some of his guitars came up for sale in GAK too. I saw him play live at The Dome too. So sad that he died with so much stil to achieve.
21358,sad,@JoeBiden @Jajixete Yeah.  You're like my Nana...  She was affectionate in the same way.  It's harmless and the story about it is probably mostly bullshit.Sad that feminists are demonizing normal human interaction.  It's as toxic as they are.
21359,sad,@enneagrampaths It’s ok! It’s not sad to me just interesting. I haven’t thought about this for a while! It’s weird when you grow up in a tight knit very sheltered community and you start to see how much of it was a lie. So many of us have a similar experience in some way even if not religious.
21360,sad,@jimercurywhore @gothfreddie Ahh ok still horrible. Like something about Mary seemed iffy to me (her removing the Freddie shrine) and your John Reid quote makes me sad for Freddie 😔💔

21365,sad,Nothing hurts more than your memory reminding you how good they were to you when they first met you and how much time they use to make for you.. it’s sad how time can change the amount of effort a person puts into making it work.
21366,sad,I apologise for tweeting sad tweets since Monday. I feel so lost right now & me not talking to anyone about this is bleh but I’ll be ready to talk to someone abt it 🙂 I’m NOT that type of peep who thinks those other bad thoughts/does bad things to themselves. So don’t worry.

21381,sad,@KendallRaeOnYT It’s not him. This is so sad. I hope whoever that boy is gets the help he needs.
21382,sad,Every day I leave work a client at my job harasses threatens and makes sexual advances at me. He will do anything to get my attention. The sad part is that he is miserable and wants me to match his energy so that he feels in control of his life.

21389,sad,@kailah_casillas Someone tweeted and said he may THINK he’s Timmothy because he has been kidnapped and made up his own identity since he was young when it happened. Sad day either way.
21390,sad,@elainaplott Love an individual who kicks another when he’s down...sad period!
21391,sad,@RonDarlingJr Since we weren’t there and ultimately money is the issue I say it’s sad if what is said is true. On the other hand speaking with all your ex-teammates would have been the wise thing to do before going ahead with the release and of course securing their ok’s on your recollections
21392,sad,@BafGomis We hope you are not sad we love you
21393,sad,I've been seeing the @dogbomb1 case lately and although I've been sad I was glad to see your posts optimistic every day while the health we debated and discouraged with things simpler than this problem .. this helped me a bit to take my own frustrations and look at each other.
21394,sad,i feel frustrated at myself for deciding to stop supporting/following an artist when i read that they dont support/believe asexuals are part of the community. //sad choke.

21406,sad,@GOPLeader You are such a sad little flunky. If trump tells you to set yourself on fire are you going to do that too. Your intentional ignorance and stubborn tribal stances are so anti-US and pro-trump profiteering. Pathetic...

21416,sad,@Sunderland_CA @SunderlandEcho I totally get where your coming from and I would love to. But its almost a matter of principle at this point. A vote in the local elections for the Tory party would be seen as a vote of support for the national party. It's very sad but I dont think I could do it.

21421,sad,Yall only want a goth gf for novelty and it makes me sad 😔
21422,sad,It seems to me at least somewhat sad that a Tory supporting twitter troll has decided to mount a series of personal attacks on the very people who started the step free access campaign for Mill Hill Broadway station. It’s as if claiming the credit for the campaign isn’t enough.

If you’re truly depressed the only thing you’d ask God for is the removal of your depression so that you could experience other emotions. The only thing that keeps me going is my faith in the unseen(god)

21860,sad,@SockMonkee64 @adarrington1 @thatboystatic @YNB @Alyssa_Milano Nobody asked for yours either and yet you felt compelled to spew it.  So much ridiculous hate. How sad pathetic and downright trumpian.
21861,sad,"@usafadanvers It is that deep grow up. It's not funny and you are not ""edgy"" for hating other characters or using prints of people's posts to hate them. It's sad and pathetic. Go promote what you like instead of hating yikes"

21867,sad,@RepDean @RepSusanWild Unfortunately this bill is DOA in the senate because you refused to negotiate with the R’s on a bipartisan bill. A waste of time at taxpayer $$.

21868,sad,I need to stop watching missing/murder cases on YouTube bc I just get so sad & mad & paranoid but I can’t stop
21869,sad,People aren't as complex as you think. They're simple and get sad or angry over simple things. That's how they are. They're quickly affected by the littlest things and live without knowing where they're going to fall down. That's who people are!

22502,sad,@joelpfc1 Shes sound mate little trooper she would usually not be arsed breaks me when I see her sad though
22503,sad,@AlexBurby In my experience that just seems to be mainstream gaming culture in general the past decade or so and entertainment & internet culture have decayed similarly. It's sad but I find I enjoy most things much more by avoiding fan communities entirely.
22504,sad,Actual so sad a miss my old twitter don’t even have anyone to make me laugh ☹️
22505,sad,@tess_CDA I’m sad to hear Liza not to accept that project of darna I wish give to kimmy bagay sa kanya darna because she’s tall and she knows how ride the horses she’s  can run she is so athletic person;;and she so sexy actress subra bagay sa kanya ang darna and so flexible her body!!
22506,sad,not to sound sad or anything but being friends with harry seems like such a privilege. he would be that type of person to ask if you’re okay or if you need anything. or if you’re having a bad day he would probably send you jokes or something to make you feel better
22507,sad,now i know how to run them. yes. they make me sad in the end. those forest plots. Jinkies.
22508,sad,Lrt makes me so sad and nostalgic
22509,sad,What was the moral of the bee movie?  That bees shouldn't keep all their honey to themselves?  Or else everyone will be sad? I think they forgot to have a moral of the story.  What was I supposed to learn?

22512,sad,It’s so sad that people consider buying a house and posting about it as bragging...why are you all such sensitive babies if the person worked hard and pays for it on their own.
22513,sad,@PolhomeEditor Sad. #ShamiChakrabiti had such a fine record as a human rights lawyer and as director of Liberty. She was an excellent and clear communicator too. Now she’s  a professional politician she ducks weaves prevaricates. And that she does not care about FOM? Tragic. #PowerCorrupts

22518,sad,@KiraLee Totally get it. When Papillon passed away when I wasn’t even home I felt similarly & was super sad. Next time you meet another animal at a friend’s house or wherever pet them & give them lots of love like you’d give Kiki. It helps.
22519,sad,@sundrownhouses IM SO SAD
22520,sad,Ever make someone smile because you know they’re sad and struggling with life even though you too are sad and struggling? If so you’re a goddamn beautiful human to me.

22527,sad,"@WonderWilbur @KareeRogue It is always scary when another dog is aggressive. Especially since it really wasn't the dog it was the human. It is super sad the people discriminate against a whole ""breed"". Doggo are individuals and should be judged individually."

22530,sad,@chelle8868 @AlecMacGillis You can see the difference in the city post Dixon and it’s very sad and troubling. She did do a lot government services were more responsive and police relations were starting to improve...and the city was cleaner! It would’ve been great to see what was to come.
22531,sad,@BafGomis don’t be sad plz we luv u💙💙💙💙
22532,sad,The documentary on #netflix about @McQueen is amazing hearing the story and seeing his creations was amazing. Such a sad ending. To be at the top of your game and feel so alone very emotive
22533,sad,And I have so much to tell some happy tidings some very sad. We lost one of our young a 2 year old to an heart attack. This amid all the nightmarish circumstances brought me to despair. But then looking for water found a couple of new kittens as if to reignite hope.
22534,sad,@StephenKing Yeah people just started doing this 2 years ago. Go with that. It makes me sad that someone so brilliant can also be such a dolt.
22535,sad,That shit sad asf killed that man just to get caught two days later smh
22536,sad,@BillGates This whole example of what people call style which is lies  is exhausting.  It is sad to see our top leader send an example out on twitter demeaning his opponents.  I really thought a Business Man would be a great example.  I wasted my vote.Yea economy is good.
22537,sad,@McJuggerNuggets Just watched video And It Was Creepy sad and cool at some point
22538,sad,Isn’t it sad that senior citizens have to sell their homes to pay for hospital bills but illegal aliens get to stay in hospitals for free? 😡
22539,sad,I’m sad and I can only breath out of one nostril right now someone either confess their love to me or end my shit right now
22540,sad,@MacLeodLisa @kinsellawarren @1979RMM @lisakinsella It's great that different minds can get along.  It's also sad that your critics can't seem to follow the lead of grown-ups. Enjoy!

22542,sad,it’s sad knowing that everytime we get a notif from billie it’ll never actually be her
22543,sad,@Drexxyzf @voodooferret @Tri7on1 @BlankSketchBook @LeagueOfLegends and Xayah/Rakan are a couple AND synergistic duo they're designed to be played together. Riot said at launch that they'd keep them matching as much as possible. so of course people are gonna be unhappy when they don't follow through.just admit you look sad and move on dude.
22544,sad,we must kill this love yeah it's sad but true waewieiwus 🙃#KILLTHISLOVEwithBLACKPINK
22545,sad,@TheCWOfficial That’s what I was think but either way I’ll be really sad 😂
22546,sad,@ethel_fenwick @nmcnews @theRCN @WeStudentNurse 3 years is simply not long enough - I'm sad to say this but the US - or the state I went to - and Australia have four year courses and certainly the training I observed was FAR superior to what I received in he UK. #Nursing
22547,sad,i get so sad when i see people my age with family members that support them and still do so much for them because i’ve never had that stuff but then i just step back and have to be thankful for the person i am because of the ways i’ve been raised
22548,sad,@frostatwork @dkbooks @The_RHS @AFgardenschool It's superb now to use the info to help me turn my sad front lawn into a garden.
22549,sad,@palermo379 @simpliciok @JRubinBlogger @JoeBiden I’m afraid people will only communicate by social media. No interaction at all sad.
22550,sad,@RitAnn @ErinMPerrine @TeamTrump So sad you believe every word of someone who lies on average ELEVEN times a day.   Maybe you ought to check out Matthew 24:24...
22551,sad,I’m making the most of what I have but it’s sad and the worst feeling in the world is knowing I did the best I could and it still ain’t f**king good enough...

22555,sad,@nonamejustheree This guy needs to crawl back into the hole he came from. I find it very sad that he's even allowed this kind of freedom when he has fucked over real MJ fans with fake autographs on all kinds of memorabilia. He should be locked up. I really hope he fails with whatever he's doing.
22556,sad,@jmcappiello Ohhh so sad really. .
22557,sad,@jinstellect IMSO SAD 🥺
22558,sad,@evening__falls @ulikethischain I think this the reason i got away from bts. Some of these fans were toxic n not to bts necessarily but to me. I felt attacked n sad when i read arrogant comments bc i wld get where they came from n it wld be funny but then insensitive. I felt leaving actually helped me ngl
22559,sad,LRT: I hope this was not malicious & more than anything I hope all families involved can get some answers. So sad.
22560,sad,I'm so sad my boyfriend invited me to go see the cherry blossoms in D.C. with him and some of his family but I have a presentation that morning for my public speaking class
22561,sad,@GOPLeader They are toxic to our country! So sad that a congress could turn our country upside down in such a short time. Hope Americans see and vote them out next election. My problem is can we recover from damage done! Somebody stop this madness
22562,sad,i just finished that 70s show and i’m sad
22563,sad,@LindseyGrahamSC It is clear you have sold your soul to Trump and for what? Even as a progressive I used to respect you but no more. Sad!
22564,sad,@ManicMike27 It's true but it's really hard to read that without being sad in a really ironic way
22565,sad,@GlutenAF @Mattielisbon @KingLuddLives @LauraIsABerner @Queen050780 @martin_mima @xanna @maydaymindy9 I am not a Biden fan. I think what he did to Anita Hill was gutless and despicable. I just think it is sad to watch all the Bernie cultists on here doing the dirty work of the GOP by attacking him the way they did Clinton.
22566,sad,going 🛰 sad hours
22567,sad,@girlsreallyrule A very sick man. This gets more tragic and sad every day.
22568,sad,@WizzyProbs The sad part is that I could actually see this story in real life.
22569,sad,The problem with going to concerts festivals and going on trips is that i get sad afterwards and to fill the void I just book more concerts/trips/festivals
22570,sad,It's sad that @Alyssa_Milano who advocates for saving animals lives won't advocate for saving human lives.  If Alyssa Milano wants a boycott then maybe she should boycott the Murdering of Babies!
22571,sad,@essenviews She's a sad excuse for a human being so there it stands.
22572,sad,@TravisAllen02 Funny but sad thing is he would if he could!!!
22573,sad,@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump He s a sitting president. how sad that this is not important to you all.
22574,sad,it’s hard being funny cause people expect jokes 24/7 BITCH IM SAD TODAY!!!!!!!!
22575,sad,@acerbic_comic @obianuju Sad thing is is that a large sum of animals have more protections than our smallest people.
22576,sad,@thefinalbigboss You're so right. It's a crazy and sad time to see such things. Who has in earlier years ever thought about this. SW was for all. But now....it's only weird what happened by Disney.

22580,sad,4th division motherfuckers ! Its sad this football ! PATHETIC ! #bologna #serieA #atalanta
22581,sad,@RepJayapal @EmmaVigeland 🤦🏽‍♀️ What a sad joke of an article. The most hilarious part of this article is the absurd statement that Bustos Jeffries and Cicilline came up with the idea for Dems to run on economic policies rather than just being anti-Trump for the midterms and thats why so many Dems won.
22582,sad,@AppFlyer I regret that I'm almost certain I'll not be able to attend. New job is all consuming these days.I am very sad to contemplate missing it.

22587,sad,I’m honestly saddened by some recent experiences of book bloggers being trolled and bullied. Is the #bookbloggers community in a crisis? I really don’t want to think so! I’ve met some generally lovely friends for life here. Sad when the joy gets spoiled 😔
22588,sad,arguing with people who think that feminism is unnecessary is so sad
22589,sad,@benton_sad WAIT SHIT HOW CLOSE

22594,sad,@frazbelina @FayebellineW The crime itself was horrific and brazen. It's sad that former DCI Hamish Campbell's 'performance' was also very disturbing. If you do write about the documentary please don't gloss over this.
22595,sad,lemme go to schleep instead of being a sad bitch 🥴

I don't want to judge anyone too harshly it makes me sad to do so but I don't know what to make of all this.
22601,sad,@realDonaldTrump This is exactly the level of class and presentation one would expect from the President of the United States. You're a sad sad lying and completely incompetent man.
22602,sad,Questioning how I never got into Kalafina until now. And of course they disbanded already so now I'm doubly sad.

22612,sad,I noticed an interesting habit.When I am angry at life I look at the sky. When I am angry with myself I look at my palm. When I am sad I look at at my belly. And where do you look when you feel bad?
22613,sad,@alessiacara It feels so close and personal to watch it. We can see how much effort and thoughts I put into the video and I have no words that could ever describe how this video and the song make me feel. It’s just so sad and beautiful at the same time. So proud of u ❤️

22620,overjoyed,@CaseyDHudson While I believe you have the honest intent about building a new team providing leadership and direction and I'm so thrilled you are back at Bioware that PR fiasco Bioware released doesn't make that statement. It reads like a someone screaming with their fingers in their ears.
22621,overjoyed,@realDonaldTrump Nit true.Your resignation would make the the country (and the free world) ecstatic.  Then again this is not about what's  best for the anyone other than The Donald.
22622,overjoyed,@IndiaSpeaksPR Not just Jinnah a nation that he has created will have enough reasons to feel elated. What is happening today is far more painful than what happened in 1947.

22638,overjoyed,@Stop_Trump20 I bet her children will be thrilled to see their mother behave like a toddler.
22639,suicidal,I don’t want to die or kill myself I just want to disappear until I feel okay again..
22640,suicidal,The Sagittarius/Jupiter dominance in my chart jumps out when I travel and then start waxing philosophical about how I’m glad I failed to kill myself because the planet is beautiful and food is delicious and I care about myself and others
22641,suicidal,@ashleyslashly Also it was proven that teens who were religious had a belief in God and went to church were less likely to commit suicide than those without a religious belief specifically in Utah.. anyways hope you have a good day!
22642,suicidal,@Jude_Houdini If someone gets far enough to commit suicide then the people who “care” weren’t helping they way they should have. Also why don’t we talk about the trauma that lead up to the suicide.... perhaps the people who “cared” inadvertently caused it.
22643,suicidal,I am in tears thankful for the support of the @WomenOfATT_ERG & #cwa3905 feminine product drive. We collected over 1300 items to deliver to the Crisis Services of North Alabama. They help individuals and families in domestic violence suicide prevention & sexual assault crises.

22649,suicidal,#RIPJeremyRichman another sad loss to #suicide absolutely heartbreaking. I can only imagine how difficult it was for them to lose their little girl in the #SandyHook tragedy but to move forward and do what they did in her memory was amazing.
22650,suicidal,"""Let’s call a spade a spade and medical aid in dying what it really is: physician-assisted suicide. As a physician myself I am all for medical aid in living!"" @NoSuicideNY @PRAFund @SyrDiocese "
22651,suicidal,People don't take other people's seriously until they commit suicide.

23719,cheerful,I’ve tried to keep a running tab of how often my husband speaks to me today in case I am being overly sensitive. I just told him a story about my day. Got one grunt and a head nod. Marriage communication is awesome and easy.

23721,cheerful,@theabsolutetom @JamesDelingpole Awesome Tom. Just awesome.
23722,cheerful,@MichaelEMann @terabytnet @Thom_Hartmann Glad to hear but at what point might it become a concern? Paleontologists have theorized that the Permian Extinction resulted from ocean warming (from Siberian Traps vulcanism) causing a meltdown of the frozen hydrates. Ultimately 99% of species disappeared. Can't happen here?

23763,sad,@Remain_Labour Labour will vote against...Tories will do the same. Sad but likely unfortunate specially for young Brits. But your country needs to turn the page of the empire bs and embrace Europe with more modesty (I'm referring to English nationalists) or else just go. Sad tbh

23771,sad,I’ll never understand how a person could have so much hate and envy in their heart to feel they have the power and right to take a life as if they don’t have the chance to obtain the very things they are hating on another person for. Sad and despicable.
23772,sad,We must kill this love. It’s sad but true.
23773,sad,@GDavisCdn Sad really. It isn’t weakness to admit when you’re wrong it’s wisdom. This is the problem with society people take a position and then become so entrenched they can’t admit when they are wrong.
23774,sad,bitches be so regretful after posting sad tweets and end up deleting most of them. that’s me. i’m bitches.

23785,sad,@ZulexZzz @sp00ster @ElizabethGray99 Second idc abt you or this argument. It just goes to show that you really live a sad life bc you like to argue on a social media platform.

23807,sad,@TiffanyKatz @DSA_LosAngeles I don't know if it's comforting or enraging to know that a very similar situation (a woman who is close to an accused man in a political org defending him and throwing survivors under the bus) happened to me and my friends with WWP baltimore. a lot of scary / sad parallels
23808,sad,I’m real life broke 🤦🏽‍♀️Shit sad 😞 I’m too old to be this broke ‼️

23832,happy,@CatholicAwesome @Chloesheehan16 I agree that women who seek abortion or who have had abortion do need care either to ensure that it’s what they want or receive support post abortion if needed.

23837,happy,@BreitbartNews It’s only been 155 years so the wounds must still be fresh.  Oh yeah no one even has a great great grandfather who was a slave.  Let’s keep going I am sure my ancestors from England and Ireland were persecuted in some way that I should be paid for.
23838,happy,army’s and blinks need to stop coming at e/o over every little thing. both groups are talented and successful and we should be happy for the other groups success! nobody’s telling you to stan the latter group but jealousy isn’t doing your idols any favors.

23846,happy,@fullmetaldonut1 @marshenio @KamehaCon @Rialisms @DocsComicsGames There was security.  Also they were happy to attend cons like Pensacon and other cons when they were facing similar backlash.  Also how does that explain the actions of the other VAs outside of Monica?They are doing it out of spite and nothing more.
23847,happy,now is not the time to question your ability. you are amply prepared for what is ahead of you. you are being put in this position to show yourself and others just how great you truly are. this situation will help you to discover your strengths and weaknesses and how to own them.

23858,happy,@DefenseSonic I can see why people act that way (altho I do not support it mind you).what makes stuff like these comics great is how much you can fall in love with them. this brings good and bad to the table.if you care too much about a francise it can hurt if it gets replaced/canceled.
23859,happy,@rphallisey845 @Aureliansage @MassAGO Honestly great questions. I’m concerned with stopping the pandemic in the schools. The industry has failed the students (I think intentionally). So let’s ban it for OTC sales and make it a prescription for those seeking to quit. Deal?
23860,happy,Hoping And Praying For @Zak_Bagans @BillyTolley @jaywasley And @agoodwincollect See This And Comment Because That Would Just Turn My Day Into A Good One. And Not Just A Day Of Horrid This Happening To Me. I've Almost Become Depressed. Happy Late Bday Aaron And Early To U Zak

23877,happy,Pretending to be happy because others want to see you happy is not only exhausting but also extremely unhealthy because you’re guilted into looking and behaving a certain way and you feel even more guilty for lying about who you really are and what you really feel.

23887,suicidal,@AuntieMoremen @MormonLibsLMAO I’ve seen this before. Suicide is sad regardless of where/who does it. If we were to assume that the teachings of the gospel were true that the things these people are supposedly feeling so distraught they would end their lives were true how would it change the conversation?

25152,depressed,@J_D_Landis Either bored or depressed
25153,depressed,Just RSVPED no to an award ceremony so I can lay in bed. U guys can mail me the award. Address it to Depression.
25154,depressed,its really hard going from a positive attitude in the opening of the year only to go back down and struggling again getting all those discarded depression and anxiety crawling into my mind again.. it is really unexpected and unforeseeable. (1/2)
25155,depressed,Depression is not a choice. I think not doing nothing about it is a choice. 🤔
25156,depressed,I wish people put the same type of energy into other MH conditions instead of just anxiety&depression there are so many mental illnesses that no one talks about causing the stigma to be even larger. They should all be treated the same.
25157,depressed,Depression sucks.
25158,depressed,@gothwords Depressed nd lonely
25159,depressed,Through all the pain and suffering all the sadness and depression all the good and the bad just know that I still wanna suck on some titties
25160,depressed,So one of my neighbours came home drunk last night at 2am took the lift to the rooftop and JUMPED to his death. So traumatizing. Guys let's check on our friends/family and find close confidants to speak to. Depression is real 😰 #RIP

25162,depressed,"""Nearly 100 million died due to WWII which was a byproduct of the Great Depression.""And what caused the Great Depression? A massive economic bubble that formed during the Roaring Twenties.My point is that we are in the Roaring Twenties right now..."
25163,depressed,Mood: in the backseat depressed listening to cyndi lauper what y’all on
25164,depressed,There are many things I wish to do on top of what I already do that I don’t find the energy for. Based on what my doctor said a lot of that is due to my severe depression and lack of serotonin. It inhibits by functionality. I hope that will improve with my new medication.
25165,depressed,i talked to Jacob today so im not as depressed lol
25166,depressed,Depression isn’t cured over night. There are slips and falls along the way to recovery. It can take months and it might even take years. All that matters is someone who is trying to go in the right direction
25167,depressed,Be the reason of someone's depression.
25168,depressed,"WROTE YESTERDAY NIGHT.Stop thinking you're depressed just because the ""given"" symptoms match to yours. Whatever you read on internet is too vague somewhat misleading.."

25170,depressed,@SweetLikeKiwiUK Try not to compare Kiwi. Our individual struggles and biochemistry are so unique. Anxiety and depression effect us all differently. Look up mindfulness excersizes and start small. Hang in there friend.

25334,cheerful,Hearing about all of this honor code BS going on at BYU is ridiculous to me. I’m glad people are finally stepping up to such a horribly flawed system. I love the gospel with all my heart but it’s really hard to like BYU because of crap like this.
25335,cheerful,I am glad to see the House has a conscience and a heart.  The Yemenis are suffering.  Saudi Arabia is a country run by evil murderous men.

25365,depressed,i genuinely feel that if i were thinner that it would majorly contribute to my happiness and that if i had money to buy nice clothes for my nice body that that would also contribute. not saying it would cure my depression but it would make me less sad
25366,depressed,@theGeekSheek @GilletteVenus Then why did someone discontinue their depression medication and lost their weight like that? she wasn't eating badly plus she excercised. It even is listed on multiple psychiatric meds.Unless you are being sarcastic?
25367,depressed,just thought about the potato flew around my room vine and my depression’s gone
25368,depressed,before we talk depression lets talk ungratefulness.
25369,depressed,@Lance210 Yes especially when you have depression and anxiety.
25370,depressed,@JodyOls02485820 It’s as if they think anyone would *willingly* choose to feel depressed as a lifestyle choice 🙄🙄🙄 !!!
25371,depressed,I guess it's way too much for me to ask anybody to love me and ease the pain of my loneliness. Damn those dung-sucking devils loneliness and #depression for driving everybody away and insisting that I remain Loneliness Incarnate! Where is the love or don't it exist at all?
25372,depressed,So creators:  what do you do when you feel people don't want your content?  I honestly feel that no one really cares about my work.  This is probably depression talking though.  I just can't build my motivation because of this fear any advice? #art #gamedev

25419,overjoyed,@ShadupJoe First i love your takes cause they are what a lot of people also said. Personally I felt overjoyed about the exploration even with the inconsistency because I had control of that inconsistency. The dungeons to me are inventive but the weakest link.
25420,overjoyed,@realDonaldTrump No worries guy. You'll drop dead someday and we'll be ecstatic.
25421,overjoyed,It's #SandboxDemoDay! We're thrilled to join @FinTechSandbox at today's demonstration as #FinTech startups present products that are solving the industry's most pressing challenges.

25429,suicidal,@CHURCHLADY320 @bjcreigh He’s an embarrassment to this country and a threat to our national security the likes of no one has seen since Hitler commited suicide.
25430,suicidal,@BigHossACS @tinye5488 @ChurchNewsroom @Fox92Terrell @poetickate The fact that you're trying to process this through the lens of scientific evidence shows that we're on different pages. I know people who have been suicidal over the way gays are treated in the church and this policy contributed to that.
25431,suicidal,I fucking hate Brexit. How a country as great as the UK can fuck itself over so bad is beyond me. Stupid little Englander mentality. 5th biggest economy in the world committing suicide. Fucking ridiculous.
25432,suicidal,It’s been a few days but I’m still thinking about that horrid pill monstrosity that was handed out at a friends ward. I’m so glad that when I told my mom at 8 years old that I wanted to kill myself she took me to a DOCTOR and didn’t tell me to pray it away.
25433,suicidal,When BMTH dropped Suicide Season they got shit on. When they dropped Amo they got shit on for not sounding like Suicide Season. That's how fans are.
25434,suicidal,@AfterLife_Fans Im a vet with PTSD get suicidal easily. This movie hit me in the feelz a great deal.  Thank you for this.

25439,suicidal,@kerosene_ghost As a survivor myself I'm truly sorry that happened to you but that doesn't justify your beliefs.Are all trans people monsters because some rape or assualt or coerce suicide? Does that make the stance that trans people deserve acceptance invalid? No it doesn't
25440,suicidal,"@MrKRudd  its brainwashing. I was sent numerous propaganda from my son's father. Within weeks he was on the phone saying to my son ""you tell Ur mum if she doesn't bring u to me now I'm going to kill myself"" & ""I'm coming to cut Ur head off"""

25450,suicidal,Trans suicide attempt rate before surgery is 40+% and it stays above 40% after the surgery. Let’s not glorify a disorder. You don’t see schizophrenic people forcing others to acknowledge that they see ghosts or that the toaster is talking to them.

25469,sad,@LisaMarieBoothe Alyssa Lisa chooses to criticize others and does nothing else to help anyone. She typifies the current admin and the average ignorant Trump supporter. Sad. Deplorable. Hypocritical.
25470,sad,@SteveTVNews @komonews So sad. Just makes you sick to see this innocent man attacked!
25471,sad,I wish I could do a cat eye. But since my vision in my right eye is SHIT and it’s also a lazy eye I could never see what I’m doing to my left eyelid because once I close that lid I basically can’t see. HAHAHA big sad :/
25472,sad,@ToriNicksWho It's so sad how we're conditioned to be afraid to speak our minds and to try to prevent confrontation by just giving in and agreeing

25487,sad,@menysnoweballes Also sad how an MP displaying a moral compass and issuing a genuine (non-mealy mouthed) apology is getting such a positive response. Shows how low current politics has sunk.
25488,sad,Funny how that “Love trumps Hate” really took hold. What a joke. Do they even know what they stand for anymore or what the status quo they defend really represents??Embarrassing and sad.
25489,sad,@elboricua375 @FPWellman @FPWellman said it perfectly. pretty damn sad when the military leadership can't say anything without the risk of losing their careers. or become a meme. wtf is the DoD doing?

25514,sad,@momma182 @NyKiLopez @simpliciok @JRubinBlogger @JoeBiden Classic blame the victim. Im sad for you.
25515,sad,@robreiner 2/2 However his unwillingness to apologize to them as somebodies whether that is by video or private note makes me very sad. The ultimate human touch is to know a person’s name. “These women” is nobody’s name.

25520,sad,The sad truth is that my MP Caroline Dinenage @cj_dinenage has been a star over Brexit. She voted remain but supports leaving the EU in Parliament and would also support No Deal if it came to it. However the party she belongs to has betrayed democracy and I can't vote for her.
25521,sad,@LifeNewsHQ @AUL @Alyssa_Milano The entertainment industry likes the tax benefits provided by Georgia legislators but not its social policies. So sad. Maybe Georgia should be less generous and allow the @Ayyssa_Milano types to stay in CA (and probably get paid less due to higher taxes).
