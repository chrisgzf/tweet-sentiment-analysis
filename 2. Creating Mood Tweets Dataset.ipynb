    "- Gives us ability to use operators to refine our search, to get cleaner data (for example, english only suicidal tweets can be expressed as \"suicidal OR suicide OR \"kill myself\" lang:en\"\n",
    "- Free version gives us 250 queries in a month, with each query giving us 100 tweets. 25000 tweets should form a sufficiently large dataset\n",
